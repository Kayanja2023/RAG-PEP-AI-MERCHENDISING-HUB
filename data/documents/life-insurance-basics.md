# Life Insurance Basics - Complete Guide

## What is Life Insurance?

Life insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company where you pay regular premiums in exchange for a lump sum payment (death benefit) to your beneficiaries when you pass away. It's designed to provide financial security for your loved ones by replacing your income and helping them maintain their standard of living.

## Why Do You Need Life Insurance?

### Financial Protection for Dependents
If others depend on your income, life insurance ensures they can continue to:
- Pay for daily living expenses
- Maintain their home
- Cover educational costs
- Pay off outstanding debts
- Maintain their lifestyle

### Debt Coverage
Life insurance can pay off:
- Mortgage bonds
- Car loans
- Personal loans
- Credit card debt
- Business loans

### Final Expenses
Cover funeral costs and other end-of-life expenses, which can be substantial and unexpected.

### Estate Planning
Create or enhance your financial legacy for your beneficiaries.

### Business Continuity
Protect your business partners and ensure business debts are covered.

## Who Needs Life Insurance?

### You Definitely Need Life Insurance If:
- You have a spouse or partner who depends on your income
- You have children or other dependents
- You have a mortgage or significant debt
- You run a business
- Someone would struggle financially if you passed away

### You Might Not Need Life Insurance If:
- You have no dependents
- You have sufficient savings to cover all final expenses and debts
- You're financially independent with no debt
- Your dependents are financially independent

## Types of Life Insurance

### Term Life Insurance
**What It Is:**
Coverage for a specific period (term) such as 10, 20, or 30 years.

**Advantages:**
- Most affordable option
- Simple and straightforward
- High coverage amounts available
- Ideal for temporary needs (mortgage, children's education)

**Disadvantages:**
- Cover ends when term expires
- No payout if you outlive the term
- Premiums increase significantly if you renew at an older age

**Best For:**
- Young families
- Temporary financial obligations
- Budget-conscious individuals
- Supplementing existing cover

### Whole Life Insurance
**What It Is:**
Permanent coverage that lasts your entire life, with a savings/investment component.

**Advantages:**
- Guaranteed payout whenever you pass away
- Level premiums (don't increase with age)
- Cash value accumulation
- Can borrow against the policy

**Disadvantages:**
- Much more expensive than term insurance
- More complex than term insurance
- Lower returns than dedicated investments

**Best For:**
- Estate planning
- Long-term financial goals
- Those who want permanent cover
- High-net-worth individuals

### Level Term vs. Decreasing Term

**Level Term:**
- Cover amount stays the same throughout the term
- Best for ongoing income replacement needs
- Higher premiums than decreasing term

**Decreasing Term:**
- Cover amount decreases over time
- Designed to match declining debt (like a mortgage)
- Lower premiums
- Often called "mortgage protection"

## How Much Life Insurance Do You Need?

### The Income Replacement Method
**Formula:** Annual income × Years of coverage needed

**Example:**
- Annual income: R600,000
- Years to cover: 10 years until children are independent
- Needed cover: R6,000,000

### The DIME Method (Debt, Income, Mortgage, Education)

**Calculate:**
1. **Debt**: Total of all debts (except mortgage): R_____
2. **Income**: Annual income × years to replace: R_____
3. **Mortgage**: Outstanding mortgage balance: R_____
4. **Education**: Cost of children's education: R_____

**Total Needed = D + I + M + E**

### The Human Life Value Method
Calculate the present value of your future earnings:
- Current age: ____
- Retirement age: ____
- Annual income: R_____
- Expected income growth: ____%
- Years to retirement: ____

### Quick Rule of Thumb
Aim for 10-12 times your annual income as a starting point.

**Example:**
- Annual income: R500,000
- Suggested cover: R5,000,000 to R6,000,000

### Adjust For:
**Increase cover if you:**
- Have young children
- Have a non-working spouse
- Have significant debt
- Have high living expenses
- Want to fund education
- Run a business

**Decrease cover if you:**
- Have substantial savings
- Have older, independent children
- Have low debt
- Have a working spouse with good income
- Have other insurance policies

## Understanding Premiums

### Factors That Affect Your Premium

**Age:**
- Younger = lower premiums
- Premiums increase significantly with age
- Lock in lower rates by buying early

**Health:**
- Medical history reviewed
- Current health conditions assessed
- Family medical history considered
- Medical exams may be required

**Lifestyle:**
- **Smoking**: Smokers pay 2-3 times more
- **Alcohol use**: Heavy drinking increases premiums
- **Dangerous hobbies**: Skydiving, rock climbing, etc.
- **Occupation**: High-risk jobs cost more

**Gender:**
- Women typically pay less (longer life expectancy)
- Difference narrows at older ages

**Coverage Amount:**
- Higher coverage = higher premium
- But cost per R1000 of cover decreases

**Policy Type:**
- Term insurance cheapest
- Whole life more expensive
- Additional riders increase cost

### Sample Premium Estimates

**Example: R2,000,000 Term Life (20-year term)**
- 30-year-old non-smoker: ~R250-350/month
- 40-year-old non-smoker: ~R450-600/month
- 30-year-old smoker: ~R600-800/month

*Note: These are rough estimates. Actual premiums vary by insurer and individual circumstances.*

5. Escalate to Ombudsman if necessary
6. Seek legal advice if warranted

## Policy Management

### Annual Review
Review your life insurance annually to ensure:
- Coverage is still adequate
- Beneficiaries are current
- Contact details are updated
- Premiums are affordable
- Policy meets changing needs

### When to Increase Coverage
- Marriage
- Birth/adoption of children
- Buying a home (mortgage)
- Income increase
- Starting a business
- Taking on significant debt

### When to Decrease Coverage
- Children become independent
- Mortgage paid off
- Retirement
- Spouse starts working
- Significant wealth accumulation

### Lapsed Policies
If you miss payments and your policy lapses:
- Coverage stops immediately
- Reinstatement may be possible within 6 months
- May require new medical underwriting
- Better to maintain policy than restart

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Insufficient Coverage
Don't underestimate needs - review calculations carefully.

### 2. Waiting Too Long
Premiums increase with age - buy when you're young and healthy.

### 3. Not Updating Beneficiaries
Keep beneficiary information current, especially after life changes.

### 4. Letting Policy Lapse
Maintain premium payments - restarting is expensive.

### 5. Not Reading Policy Documents
Understand what's covered and what's excluded.

### 6. Buying Based on Price Alone
Cheapest isn't always best - consider coverage quality and insurer reputation.

### 7. Not Disclosing Medical Conditions
Always disclose fully - non-disclosure can void your policy.

## Tax Implications

### Tax Benefits
- Life insurance premiums may be tax-deductible (consult tax advisor)
- Death benefits are typically tax-free to beneficiaries
- No capital gains tax on payout

### Estate Duty
- Payouts to estate may be subject to estate duty
- Payouts to nominated beneficiaries bypass estate
- Proper planning can minimize estate duty

### Consult a Tax Professional
Tax laws change - get professional advice for your specific situation.
