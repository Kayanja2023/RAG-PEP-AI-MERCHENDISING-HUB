**Actions:**
1. Review sales data and stock levels
2. Analyze market trends and competitor activity
3. Identify product opportunities
4. Define specifications (size, color, quality, price point)
5. Request samples from potential suppliers

**Responsibility:** Category Buyer

---

### Step 2: Sample Evaluation

**Sample Request:**
- Submit sample request form to supplier
- Specify: Style, size, color, quantity (typically 3-5 pieces)
- Include target retail price for costing guidance
- Set sample delivery deadline

**Evaluation Criteria:**

---

### Step 3: Costing & Pricing Analysis

**Landed Cost Calculation:**
```
Landed Cost = FOB Cost + Freight + Import Duties + Other Costs

Where:
- FOB Cost: Ex-factory price from supplier
- Freight: Shipping costs (sea/air/road)
- Import Duties: Customs duties based on HS code (typically 20-45% for clothing)
- Other Costs: Insurance, clearing fees, warehousing

Example:
FOB Cost: R50.00
Freight: R5.00
Duty (20%): R11.00
Other: R1.00
Total Landed Cost: R67.00
```

**Retail Price Determination:**
```
Retail Price = Landed Cost ÷ (1 - Target Margin %)

Example:
Landed Cost: R67.00
Target Margin: 40%
Calculation: R67.00 ÷ 0.60 = R111.67
Rounded Retail: R119.99 or R129.99 (price point strategy)
```

**Margin Targets by Category:**
- Basic clothing: 35-40%
- Fashion clothing: 40-45%
- Footwear: 40-45%
- School uniforms: 30-35%
- Homeware: 35-40%
- Electronics: 25-30%

**Cost Approval:**
- Costing must be approved before PO creation
- All costs documented in costing sheet
- Competitive benchmarking required

**Responsibility:** Buyer + Merchandising Planner

---

### Step 4: Quantity Planning

**Factors to Consider:**
1. **Historical Sales:** Previous season performance
2. **Market Size:** Total addressable market for category
3. **Store Grade:** A/B/C store classification
4. **Seasonality:** Peak vs. off-peak demand
5. **Promotional Plans:** Marketing support
6. **Shelf Life:** Fashion risk vs. basic replenishment

**Calculation Methods:**

**Option A: Historical Analysis**
```
Planned Quantity = Last Year Sales × Growth Factor × In-stock Weeks

Example:
Last Year: 10,000 units sold
Growth: 10%
In-stock: 12 weeks
Calculation: 10,000 × 1.10 × (12÷52) = 2,538 units
```

**Option B: Store Allocation**
```
Total Quantity = (A Stores × A Depth) + (B Stores × B Depth) + (C Stores × C Depth)

Example:
Grade A Stores: 500 stores × 6 units = 3,000 units
Grade B Stores: 1,200 stores × 4 units = 4,800 units
Grade C Stores: 800 stores × 2 units = 1,600 units
Total: 9,400 units
```

**Size & Color Mix:**
- Apply standard curves per category
- Adjust for regional preferences
- Account for supplier MOQs

**Approval Required:** Merchandiser sign-off on quantities

**Responsibility:** Merchandising Planner
