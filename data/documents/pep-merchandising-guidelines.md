## Merchandising Principles

### 1. Customer-Centric Assortment

**Core Philosophy:**
- Understand target customer: Budget-conscious families, value seekers
- Offer: Good quality at affordable prices
- Balance: Basic needs + aspirational fashion

**Assortment Pillars:**
1. **Core/Never Out of Stock (NOOS):** 40-50% of range
   - Basic t-shirts, school uniforms, everyday items
   - Continuous replenishment
   - Proven sellers with low fashion risk

2. **Seasonal Fashion:** 30-40% of range
   - Trend-responsive items
   - Seasonal colors and styles
   - Higher margins, higher risk

3. **Promotional/Value:** 15-20% of range
   - Special buys and promotions
   - Traffic drivers
   - Competitive pricing focus

**Application:**
- Every category must balance these three pillars
- Adjust ratios based on category fashion intensity
- Review mix quarterly

---

### 2. Value Equation

**PEP Promise:** Quality × Style ÷ Price = Maximum Value

**Execution:**
- Never compromise quality for lowest price
- Offer fashionable designs at accessible price points
- Benchmar competitive regularly
- Communicate value clearly in stores

---

### 3. Wide & Shallow vs. Deep & Narrow

**Wide & Shallow (Fashion Categories):**
- Many styles, limited depth per style
- Reduces markdown risk
- Example: Ladies' fashion dresses - 50 styles × 100 units = 5,000 total

**Deep & Narrow (Basic Categories):**
- Few styles, significant depth per style
- Ensures availability
- Example: School shirts - 5 styles × 2,000 units = 10,000 total

**Decision Criteria:**
| Factor | Wide & Shallow | Deep & Narrow |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Fashion Risk | High | Low |
| Replenishment | Difficult | Easy |
| Customer Expectation | Variety | Availability |
| Markdown Risk | Higher | Lower |

---

## Category Management

### Category Roles

Every category is assigned a strategic role:

**1. Destination Categories (15-20% of categories)**
- Why customers visit PEP
- Must-win categories
- Examples: School uniforms, affordable fashion, cellphones
- Investment: Maximum space, marketing, best locations

**2. Routine Categories (50-60% of categories)**
- Expected basics and essentials
- Fill weekly shopping basket
- Examples: Socks, underwear, basics, homeware essentials
- Investment: Adequate space, consistent availability

**3. Occasional/Seasonal Categories (20-30% of categories)**
- Purchase frequency: Seasonal or occasional
- Examples: Winter jackets, festive party wear, beach towels
- Investment: Seasonal space allocation, targeted promotion

**4. Convenience Categories (5-10% of categories)**
- Impulse or add-on purchases
- Examples: Accessories, small electronics, gift items
- Investment: Checkout adjacency, minimal space

**Category Role Review:** Annually, based on sales contribution and strategic fit

## Assortment Planning

### Range Building Methodology

**Step 1: Historical Analysis**
```
Sales by:
- Sub-category
- Price point
- Color
- Size
- Style attributes (e.g., sleeveless vs. short sleeve)
```

**Step 2: Market Gaps Identification**
- What's missing in current range?
- Competitor offerings we lack
- Customer feedback/requests
- Trend opportunities

**Step 3: Range Structure**

**Example: Ladies' Tops (Summer Season)**

| Sub-Category | % of Range | Style Count | Avg Units/Style | Total Units |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Basic Tees | 25% | 15 | 2,000 | 30,000 |
| Fashion Tops | 35% | 40 | 500 | 20,000 |
| Blouses | 20% | 25 | 400 | 10,000 |
| Vests/Tanks | 20% | 20 | 500 | 10,000 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **100** | - | **70,000** |

**Step 4: Price Point Architecture**

**Good-Better-Best Strategy:**
- Entry/Good: 40% of styles (lowest prices, high volume)
- Better: 40% of styles (mid-price, balanced)
- Best: 20% of styles (fashion/quality, lower volume)

**Example: Ladies' Dresses**
- Entry: R79.99 - R99.99 (basic cuts, solid colors)
- Better: R129.99 - R149.99 (prints, details, better fabric)
- Best: R179.99 - R199.99 (trend styles, premium finishes)

**Step 5: Color Selection**

**Core Colors (60% of units):**
- Black, white, navy, grey (always in demand)
- Continuous availability critical

**Fashion Colors (30% of units):**
- Seasonal trend colors (e.g., coral, mint green)
- Refresh each season

**Statement Colors (10% of units):**
- Bold, niche appeal (e.g., mustard yellow, electric blue)
- Limited quantities, test and react

**Color Forecasting Sources:**
- Pantone Fashion Color Report
- International trade shows
- Competitor analysis
- Social media trends

- **September-October:** Production and shipping
- **November:** Stock arrives, pre-packs to stores
- **December 1:** Merchandise in stores
- **January peak:** Highest sales period
- **Mid-February:** Clear remaining stock

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Availability:** Never out of stock on core sizes (ages 6-13, key sizes)

- Depth by store grade:
  - A stores: 20-30 units per style
  - B stores: 10-15 units per style
  - C stores: 5-8 units per style

**Contingency:**
- Hold 10-15% of stock centrally for rapid replenishment

---

## Store Grading & Allocation

### Store Classification

**Grading Criteria:**
1. **Sales Volume:** Total store turnover
2. **Foot Traffic:** Customer visits per week
3. **Store Size:** Trading square meters
4. **Catchment Area:** Population density, income levels, competition
5. **Location Type:** Mall, high street, township, rural

**Grade Definitions:**

**Grade A Stores (~20% of stores, 50% of sales):**
- High volume, high traffic
- Premium locations (major malls, city centers)
- Size: 800-1,500 sqm
- Full range allocation
- Priority for new launches and limited editions

**Grade B Stores (~50% of stores, 40% of sales):**
- Medium volume
- Good locations (regional malls, busy high streets)
- Size: 400-800 sqm
- Core range + selected fashion
- Standard allocation

**Grade C Stores (~30% of stores, 10% of sales):**
- Lower volume
- Smaller towns, rural areas
- Size: 200-400 sqm
- Core basics + limited fashion
- Conservative allocation (proven sellers only)

**Re-Grading:** Annually, based on previous year performance

---

### Allocation Principles

**1. Style Selection by Grade:**
- **A Stores:** 100% of range (all styles)
- **B Stores:** 70-80% of range (exclude niche/experimental)
- **C Stores:** 40-50% of range (core basics + proven sellers)

**2. Depth by Grade:**

**Example: Ladies' Fashion Top (Style #12345)**
- Total Buy: 10,000 units
- A Stores (500 stores × 8 units): 4,000 units (40%)
- B Stores (1,200 stores × 4 units): 4,800 units (48%)
- C Stores (800 stores × 1-2 units): 1,200 units (12%)

**3. Regional Preferences:**
- Climate: More warm clothing in colder regions
- Demographics: Adjust size curves for age/ethnicity trends
- Cultural: Modest fashion in certain areas
- Economic: Price point mix adjusted for income levels

**4. Launch Timing:**
- A Stores: Week 1 (immediate launch)
- B Stores: Week 1-2
- C Stores: Week 2-3 (validate sell-through first)

**5. Replenishment:**
- A Stores: Weekly replenishment, priority stock
- B Stores: Bi-weekly, second priority
- C Stores: Monthly, final allocation after A/B demand met

---

### Size & Color Allocation

**Optimize by Store:**
- Not all stores need full size curve
- Small stores: Focus on peak sizes (M, L, XL)
- Tourist areas: Smaller sizes (international visitors)
- Use store-specific sell-through data to refine

**Example:**
- **National Size Curve:** XS(5%), S(15%), M(25%), L(25%), XL(15%), XXL(10%), 3XL(5%)
- **Small C Store Allocation:** M(35%), L(35%), XL(20%), XXL(10%) [skip XS, S, 3XL]

**Color Allocation:**
- Core colors: All stores
- Fashion colors: A & B stores only
- Statement colors: A stores only or limited test

---

## Markdown Management

### Markdown Philosophy

**Goals:**
1. **Maximize full-price sell-through:** Target 70-75% at full price
2. **Minimize aged stock:** Clear seasonal items within season
3. **Maintain brand perception:** Avoid constant discounting
4. **Optimize cash flow:** Convert stock to cash efficiently

---

### Markdown Triggers

**Automatic Triggers:**
1. **Time-based:**
   - 60 days in-store: Review performance
   - 90 days in-store: First markdown (typically 20-30%)
   - 120 days in-store: Second markdown (40-50%)
   - 150+ days: Final clearance (60-70%)

2. **Performance-based:**
   - Sell-through < 30% after 45 days: Early markdown
   - Seasonal end approaching: Aggressive markdown
   - Replenishment arrival: Clear older stock first

3. **Event-based:**
   - End-of-season sales
   - Promotional campaigns (e.g., Winter Clearance)
   - Stock room overflow: Make space for new season

---

### Markdown Authorization Process

**Approval Levels:**

| Markdown % | Stock Value | Approver | Turnaround |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Up to 20% | Any | Category Merchandiser | Same day |
| 21-40% | Up to R500k | Buying Manager | 1 day |
| 41-60% | Up to R1m | Head of Merchandising | 2 days |
| Over 60% | Any | Head of Merchandising + CFO | 3 days |

**Process:**
1. **Identify:** Stock requiring markdown (age, sell-through, season-end)
2. **Analyze:** Current stock value, recommended markdown %, projected sell-through
3. **Propose:** Complete markdown request form with business case
4. **Approve:** Submit for authorization
5. **Execute:** Update pricing in system, communicate to stores
6. **Monitor:** Track uplift in sales, adjust if needed

---

### Markdown Strategy by Category

**Fashion Categories (Higher Markdown Risk):**
- Accept 20-30% markdown rate
- Early and aggressive markdowns
- Don't hold fashion items beyond season
- Example: Ladies' fashion dresses

**Basic Categories (Lower Markdown Risk):**
- Target <10% markdown rate
- Conservative buying
- Carry basics year-round
- Example: White school shirts

**Seasonal Categories:**
- Plan for 15-25% markdown
- Clear before next season arrives
- Use promotional events (Winter Sale, Summer Clearance)
- Example: Winter jackets

---

### Promotional Pricing vs. Markdown

**Promotional Pricing (Planned):**
- Built into margin plan
- Traffic drivers, competitive response
- Examples: "3 for R99", "Buy 2 Get 1 Free", "R10 off"
- Temporary, returns to full price

**Markdown (Unplanned):**
- Permanent price reduction
- Due to poor performance or age
- Erodes planned margin
- Rarely returns to full price

**Preference:** Plan promotions strategically rather than reactive markdowns

---

## Visual Merchandising & Space Management

### Space Allocation Principles

**1. Sales Productivity:**
- Allocate space based on sales per square meter
- High performers earn more space
- Review quarterly

**Formula:**
```
Space Allocation (sqm) = Category Sales ÷ Total Store Sales × Total Store Space

Example:
Ladies' Clothing Sales: R500,000
Total Store Sales: R2,000,000
Total Store Space: 600 sqm
Ladies' Clothing Space = (R500k ÷ R2,000k) × 600 = 150 sqm
```

**2. Strategic Importance:**
- Destination categories may receive more space than sales justify (investment)
- Convenience categories less space (impulse, high margin)

**3. Seasonality:**
- Flex space allocation by season
- Example: Winter knitwear expands in winter, contracts in summer

---

### Planogram Guidelines

**Fixtures:**
- Use standard PEP fixtures for consistency
- Wall displays: Fashion, face-out for visibility
- Floor fixtures: Basics, folded and stacked
- Gondolas: Accessories, small items

**Product Flow:**
- Entry: Promotional, new arrivals, traffic drivers
- Middle: Core categories, easy navigation
- Rear: Basics (draw customers through store)
- Checkout: Impulse items (accessories, small gifts)

**Height Strategy:**
- Eye level (120-160cm): Best sellers, high margin
- Above eye level: Bulk stock, less fashionable
- Below waist (60cm): Kids' items, bulky items, low-value basics

**Color Blocking:**
- Group by color for visual impact
- Dark to light, or rainbow spectrum
- Creates Instagram-worthy displays

**Density:**
- Avoid over-cramming (feels messy, cheap)
- Leave breathing room (easier to shop)
- Balance accessibility with maximizing stock on floor

---

### Signage & Communication

**Types:**
1. **Category Signage:** Clear wayfinding ("School Uniforms", "Ladies' Shoes")
2. **Promotional Signage:** Highlight deals ("3 for R99", "New Arrival")
3. **Pricing:** Large, clear, visible
4. **Seasonal:** Create atmosphere (back-to-school, festive)

**Best Practices:**
- Consistent branding (PEP red, fonts, style)
- Readable from 3-5 meters away
- Professional, not handwritten
- Change regularly (avoid faded/dated signs)

---

## Performance Measurement

### Key Merchandising Metrics

**1. Sales Performance:**
- **Sales Growth:** YoY, budgeted vs. actual
- **Like-for-Like (LFL) Sales:** Same-store growth
- **Sales per Square Meter:** Space productivity

**2. Inventory Management:**
- **Stock Turn:** Sales ÷ Average Stock (Target: 4-6× per year)
- **Weeks of Supply:** Current Stock ÷ Avg Weekly Sales (Target: 8-12 weeks)
- **Fill Rate:** % of orders fulfilled (Target: >95%)

**3. Profitability:**
- **Gross Margin %:** (Sales - COGS) ÷ Sales (Target: 35-45% varies by category)
- **GMROI:** Gross Margin Rand ÷ Average Inventory Investment (Target: >2.0)
- **Markdown %:** Markdown Rand ÷ Total Sales (Target: <20%)

**4. Product Performance:**
- **Sell-Through %:** Units Sold ÷ Units Received (Target: 70-80% full price)
- **Options Count:** Number of styles/SKUs active
- **Age of Inventory:** % of stock >90 days old (Target: <15%)

---

### Dashboard Reporting

**Weekly Dashboard (Operational Focus):**
- Sales vs. last year, budget
- Top 10 sellers, bottom 10 performers
- Stock outs (critical items)
- Aged stock alerts (>90 days)

**Monthly Dashboard (Tactical Review):**
- Category sales deep dive
- Margin analysis
- Inventory health (turn, age, weeks of supply)
- New launch performance
- Markdown activity

**Quarterly Dashboard (Strategic Review):**
- Category strategy progress
- Market share trends
- Customer insights
- Competitive landscape
- Long-term opportunities/risks

---

## Risk Management

### Inventory Risk

**Over-Stock Risk:**
- Causes: Over-buying, poor sell-through, fashion misses
- Impact: Markdown loss, cash tied up, space constraints
- Mitigation: Conservative buys on new items, test-and-react, early markdowns

**Under-Stock Risk:**
- Causes: Conservative buying, supplier delays, unexpected demand
- Impact: Lost sales, customer disappointment, competitor advantage
- Mitigation: Safety stock on basics, backup suppliers, rapid replenishment

---

### Fashion Risk

**Trend Forecast Errors:**
- Fashion is inherently unpredictable
- Mitigation:
  - Diversify: Many styles, limited depth
  - Late buys: Closer to season start
  - Fast fashion: Short lead times (30-45 days)
  - Customer feedback: Test small, react to winners

---

### Supplier Risk

**Single Supplier Dependency:**
- Risk: Supplier failure, quality issues, delays
- Mitigation:
  - Multi-source key categories
  - Maintain relationships with backup suppliers
  - Regular supplier performance reviews

---

### Currency Risk

**Import Price Volatility:**
- Rand weakness increases landed costs
- Mitigation:
  - Hedge currency for large orders (Finance team)
  - Negotiate longer payment terms (delay conversion)
  - Local sourcing where viable
  - Price architecture with buffer for volatility

---

## Sustainability & Ethics

### Sustainable Merchandising

**Priorities:**
1. **Reduce Waste:** Better forecasting, less over-stock
2. **Longer-Lasting Products:** Durability reduces replacement cycle
3. **Responsible Sourcing:** Ethical factories, safe materials
4. **Packaging:** Minimize excess, recyclable materials
5. **End-of-Life:** Donation programs for unsold stock

**Initiatives:**
- Partner with suppliers on sustainability improvements
- Communicate sustainability efforts to customers
- Balance sustainability with affordability (PEP value promise)

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Season Post-Mortem

**After Each Season:**
1. **What Worked:** Best sellers, margin winners, operational successes
2. **What Didn't:** Poor performers, margin erosion, process breakdowns
3. **Lessons Learned:** Key insights for next season
4. **Action Plan:** Specific changes to implement

**Documentation:** Seasonal review report (shared with team)

---

### Innovation & Testing

**Encourage Experimentation:**
- Allocate 5-10% of OTB for test concepts
- Small quantities, limited stores
- Learn fast, fail fast, scale winners
- Examples: New sub-categories, collaborations, exclusive lines

---

## FAQs

**Q: How do I decide between wide & shallow vs. deep & narrow?**  
A: Assess fashion risk. High risk = wide & shallow. Low risk (basics, proven sellers) = deep & narrow.

**Q: When should I markdown a slow seller?**  
A: At 60 days, review sell-through. If <30%, consider markdown. At 90 days, mandatory markdown if not improved.

**Q: How do I balance margin goals with competitive pricing?**  
A: Focus on landed cost reduction, not just higher retail. Match competitor pricing on key value items (KVIs), earn margin on differentiated items.

**Q: Can I skip the markdown approval process for urgent clearance?**  
A: No. Always follow approval hierarchy. For genuinely urgent situations, contact Buying Manager directly for expedited approval.

**Q: How much stock should I hold centrally vs. allocate to stores?**  
A: Typically 10-15% centrally for replenishment. Basics can be higher (20%), fashion lower (5%).
