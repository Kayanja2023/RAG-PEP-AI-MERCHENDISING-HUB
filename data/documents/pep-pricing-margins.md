# PEP Pricing & Margins

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2025  
**Purpose:** Pricing strategies, margin targets, calculation formulas, and promotional guidelines

---

## Overview

Pricing at PEP balances three critical objectives:
1. **Value for Customers:** Affordable prices for target market
2. **Competitive Positioning:** Match or beat key competitors on value items
3. **Profitable Growth:** Achieve margin targets to sustain business

This document provides comprehensive guidance on pricing decisions, margin management, and promotional pricing strategies.

## Pricing Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Value Leadership:**
- PEP promise: "Good quality at affordable prices"
- Not necessarily the cheapest, but best value equation
- Perception management: Communicate quality + price advantage

**2. Psychological Pricing:**
- Use .99 endings (R79.99, not R80.00)
- Perceived value: R79.99 feels significantly less than R80
- Exception: Round pricing for very low items (R5, R10)

**3. Price Architecture:**
- Clear good-better-best tiers
- Logical price laddering within category
- No price gaps too large or too small (dilutes structure)

**4. Price Stability:**
- Avoid frequent price changes (confuses customers)
- Change prices seasonally or with major cost changes
- Promotional pricing temporary and planned

---

## Margin Fundamentals

### Margin vs. Markup: Understanding the Difference

**Markup:** Percentage added to cost to determine retail price
```
Markup % = (Retail Price - Cost) ÷ Cost × 100

Example:
Cost: R60
Retail: R100
Markup = (R100 - R60) ÷ R60 × 100 = 66.67%
```

**Margin (Gross Margin):** Percentage of retail price that is profit
```
Margin % = (Retail Price - Cost) ÷ Retail Price × 100

Example:
Cost: R60
Retail: R100
Margin = (R100 - R60) ÷ R100 × 100 = 40%
```

**Key Insight:** Same numbers, different percentages. Always clarify which is being discussed.

**Conversion Formulas:**
```
Margin % = Markup % ÷ (100 + Markup %) × 100
Markup % = Margin % ÷ (100 - Margin %) × 100
```

---

### Target Margin by Category

| Category | Target Gross Margin | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **School Uniforms** | 30-35% | Price-sensitive, high volume, low risk |
| **Basic Clothing** | 35-40% | Repeatable, low fashion risk |
| **Fashion Clothing** | 40-45% | Higher risk, shorter lifecycle |
| **Footwear** | 40-45% | Import-heavy, quality critical |
| **Knitwear** | 38-42% | Seasonal, competitive |
| **Homeware** | 35-40% | Volume play, basics |
| **Electronics** | 25-30% | Competitive, price transparency |
| **Cellphones** | 20-28% | Highly competitive, brand dictated |
| **Accessories** | 45-50% | Impulse, low cost base |

**Weighted Average Target:** 35-40% across total business

## Cost Calculations

### Landed Cost Formula

**Complete Calculation:**
```
Landed Cost = FOB Cost + Freight + Duties + Clearance + Insurance + Warehousing + Other

Detailed Breakdown:
1. FOB Cost: Ex-factory supplier price
2. Freight: Shipping to SA (sea/air/road)
3. Duties: Import tax (varies by HS code)
4. Clearance: Customs broker fees
5. Insurance: Cargo insurance (typically 0.5-1% of goods value)
6. Warehousing: Receiving and handling at DC
7. Other: Any additional logistics costs
```

**Typical Component Percentages (as % of FOB):**
- Freight (sea): 8-12% of FOB
- Duties: 20-45% of (FOB + Freight) depending on product
- Clearance: 1-2% of goods value
- Insurance: 0.5-1% of goods value
- Warehousing: 2-3% of goods value

---

### Example: Ladies' T-Shirt (Imported from China)

**Step 1: FOB Cost**
- Supplier price: R25.00 per unit

**Step 2: Freight**
- Sea freight: R2.50 per unit (10% of FOB)

**Step 3: Duties**
- Dutiable value: FOB + Freight = R27.50
- Duty rate (HS code 6109): 40% on clothing
- Duty: R27.50 × 0.40 = R11.00

**Step 4: Other Costs**
- Clearance: R0.50
- Insurance: R0.30
- Warehousing: R0.70
- Total other: R1.50

**Total Landed Cost:**
```
R25.00 (FOB) + R2.50 (Freight) + R11.00 (Duty) + R1.50 (Other) = R40.00
```

**Step 5: Determine Retail Price**
- Target margin: 40% (fashion basic)
- Calculation: R40.00 ÷ (1 - 0.40) = R40.00 ÷ 0.60 = R66.67
- Rounded retail: **R69.99** (psychological pricing)

**Step 6: Verify Margin**
```
Margin = (R69.99 - R40.00) ÷ R69.99 × 100 = 42.9%
✓ Exceeds target 40%, approved
```

---

### Local Supply Example: School Shirt (SA Manufacturer)

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Ex-factory price: R35.00 (no duties, local)
- Freight (Johannesburg to DC): R1.50
- Warehousing: R0.50
- **Total Landed Cost: R37.00**

**Retail Pricing:**
- Target margin: 32% (school uniforms)
- Calculation: R37.00 ÷ (1 - 0.32) = R37.00 ÷ 0.68 = R54.41
- Rounded retail: **R54.99**

**Margin Check:**
```
Margin = (R54.99 - R37.00) ÷ R54.99 × 100 = 32.7%
✓ On target
```

**Advantage of Local Sourcing:**
- No import duties (saves 20-45%)
- Shorter lead times
- Easier quality control
- Lower logistics costs

## Pricing Strategies

### Price Point Architecture

**Good-Better-Best Framework:**

**Example: Ladies' Dresses**

| Tier | Price Range | Features | Target Margin | Volume Expectation |
|------|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Good** | R79.99 - R99.99 | Basic cuts, solid colors, simple fabric | 38-40% | High (40% of units) |
| **Better** | R129.99 - R149.99 | Fashion prints, details, better fabric | 42-44% | Medium (40% of units) |
| **Best** | R179.99 - R199.99 | Trend styles, premium finishes, unique | 45-48% | Low (20% of units) |

**Benefits:**
1. Captures different customer segments
2. Allows trade-up selling
3. Balances volume and margin
4. Creates price perception anchors (R199 makes R129 feel like good value)

---

### Competitive Pricing

**Key Value Items (KVIs):**
- Items customers compare across stores
- Examples: School shirts, basic jeans, white t-shirts, school shoes
- Strategy: **Must match or beat competitors**
- Willing to accept lower margin (28-32%) on KVIs

**Monitored Competitors:**
1. Ackermans (primary)
2. Jet
3. Woolworths (quality benchmark)
4. Mr Price (fashion, youth)
5. Pick n Pay Clothing
6. Local independent stores

**Price Tracking:**
- Monthly mystery shopping (10-15 key items)
- Record competitor prices
- Adjust PEP prices if out of competitive range

**Example Decision:**
- **School white shirt (Grade 6):**
  - PEP Cost: R37.00
  - Target Margin: 32% → Retail R54.99
  - Ackermans Price: R49.99
  - **Decision:** Match at R49.99 (margin drops to 26%, but critical KVI)

---

### Regional Pricing

**Current PEP Strategy:** **National uniform pricing**
- Same price in all stores (Cape Town, rural towns, townships)
- Simplifies operations and systems
- Clear brand positioning

**Future Consideration (Not Current Practice):**
- Regional pricing possible with advanced systems
- Adjust for local competition and income levels
- Complex to manage, communicate

---

## Promotional Pricing

### Types of Promotions

**1. Percentage Discount**
- Example: "20% off all winter jackets"
- Clear, easy to understand
- Margin impact: Direct reduction (40% margin → 32% margin at 20% off)

**2. Multi-Buy Offers**
- Example: "3 for R99" or "Buy 2, Get 1 Free"
- Encourages higher basket size
- Calculate effective discount:
  ```
  3 for R99 (normally R39.99 each)
  Regular total: R39.99 × 3 = R119.97
  Discount: R119.97 - R99.00 = R20.97
  Effective discount: R20.97 ÷ R119.97 = 17.5% off
  ```

**3. Bundle Pricing**
- Example: "School uniform set R299 (save R50)"
- Perceived higher value
- Convenience for customer
- Can bundle slower sellers with fast movers

**4. Threshold Discounts**
- Example: "Spend R500, get R50 off"
- Drives basket size
- Customer calculates total, adds items to qualify

**5. Price Point Promotions**
- Example: "Everything R20 or less in this section"
- Creates treasure hunt excitement
- Good for clearance items

---

### Promotional Planning

**Annual Promotional Calendar:**

| Month | Event | Categories | Type |
|-------|-------|------------|------|
| January | New Year Sale | Fashion, homeware | % discount, R-off |
| February | Back-to-School Last Chance | Uniforms, shoes | Multi-buy |
| March | Autumn Launch | New season | Bundle deals |
| April | Easter | Kids' fashion | 3 for deals |
| May | Mid-Year | Selected items | Price point |
| June | Winter Sale | Knitwear, jackets | % discount |
| July | Christmas in July | Homeware | Bundle |
| August | Spring Preview | New season | Spend & Save |
| September | Heritage Day | Traditional items | R-off |
| October | Summer Launch | Summer fashion | Multi-buy |
| November | Black Friday | Storewide | Storewide % |
| December | Festive Frenzy | Gifts, party wear | Mix of all |

---

### Promotion Financial Planning

**Margin Impact Calculation:**

**Example: 20% Off Winter Jacket Promotion**
- Regular retail: R299.99
- Regular margin: 42% (Cost: R174.00)
- Promotion price: R299.99 × 0.80 = R239.99
- Promotion margin: (R239.99 - R174.00) ÷ R239.99 = 27.5%
- **Margin erosion: 42% - 27.5% = 14.5 points**

**Volume Offset:**
- Must sell more units to offset margin loss
- Breakeven calculation:
  ```
  Regular: 1,000 units × R299.99 × 42% margin = R125,996 gross profit
  Promotion margin per unit: R239.99 × 27.5% = R66.00
  Units needed: R125,996 ÷ R66.00 = 1,909 units
  
  Need 91% increase in volume to maintain same profit
  ```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Will sales increase enough to offset margin loss?
2. Is goal sales/profit or clearance of aged stock?
3. Competitive necessity?
4. Long-term customer goodwill?

---

### Promotional Approval Process

| Promotion Type | Margin Impact | Approver | Lead Time |
|----------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Minor (< 10% off) | Low | Category Merchandiser | 1 week |
| Standard (10-20% off) | Medium | Buying Manager | 2 weeks |
| Major (20-30% off) | High | Head of Merchandising | 3 weeks |
| Storewide (30%+ off) | Very High | Head + CFO | 4 weeks |

**Required Documentation:**
1. Promotion plan (items, discount, duration)
2. Financial impact (margin before/after, volume assumption)
3. Marketing support (signage, ads)
4. Competitive context
5. Clearance or traffic objective

---

## Markdown Pricing

**Difference from Promotional Pricing:**
- Promotional: Temporary, planned, returns to full price
- Markdown: Permanent price reduction, typically won't return to full price

### Markdown Schedule

**First Markdown (60-90 days old):**
- Reduction: 20-30%
- Example: R149.99 → R119.99 (20% off)
- Goal: Stimulate demand, extend life

**Second Markdown (90-120 days old):**
- Reduction: 40-50% (cumulative)
- Example: R149.99 → R99.99 (33% off) or R89.99 (40% off)
- Goal: Clear significant volume

**Final Clearance (120+ days old):**
- Reduction: 60-70% (cumulative)
- Example: R149.99 → R49.99 (67% off)
- Goal: Liquidate remaining stock, free up space

**Below Cost Clearance:**
- Last resort (better than no sale)
- Requires senior approval (CFO level)
- Example: Cost R60, final clearance R39.99
- Accept loss to clear space, recover some cash

---

### Markdown Financial Impact

**Example: Fashion Dress Markdown**

**Purchase:**
- Units: 1,000
- Cost: R60.00 each
- Retail: R149.99 (60% margin)

**Sell-Through:**
- Full price (R149.99): 600 units = R89,994 sales
- First markdown (R119.99): 250 units = R29,998 sales
- Second markdown (R89.99): 100 units = R8,999 sales
- Final clearance (R49.99): 50 units = R2,500 sales
- **Total sales: R131,491**

**Costs & Profit:**
- Total cost: 1,000 × R60 = R60,000
- Gross profit: R131,491 - R60,000 = R71,491
- **Blended margin: 54.4%** (vs. 60% if all full price)
- **Margin loss due to markdowns: 5.6 points**

**Lessons:**
- High full-price sell-through critical (60% in this example)
- Markdowns erode profitability significantly
- Better forecasting = less markdown = higher margin

---

## Margin Management

### Achieving Margin Targets

**1. Cost Negotiation:**
- Volume discounts from suppliers
- Annual contracts with fixed pricing
- Direct sourcing (eliminate intermediaries)
- Alternative materials or construction (value engineering)
- **Impact:** Every R1.00 cost reduction = 1.5% margin improvement (at R69.99 retail)

**2. Retail Price Optimization:**
- Test higher price points on new items
- Price increases on proven sellers (if market allows)
- Premium lines with higher margins
- **Risk:** Price elasticity (higher price = lower volume)

**3. Markdown Reduction:**
- Better forecasting
- Smaller buys on fashion risk items
- Early intervention (first markdown at 60 days, not 90)
- **Impact:** 5% markdown rate reduction = 2-3% margin improvement

**4. Mix Management:**
- Grow high-margin categories (accessories, fashion)
- Maintain but don't over-invest in low-margin (electronics)
- Promote high-margin items in stores
- **Impact:** Shift mix by 5% toward high-margin = 1-2% overall margin improvement

---

### Margin Monitoring

**Weekly Tracking:**
- Margin % by category
- Red/amber/green vs. target
- Immediate action on significant variances

**Monthly Analysis:**
- Margin bridge: Budget → Actual
  - Impact of: Sales mix, markdowns, cost changes, shrinkage
- Corrective action plans

**Example Margin Bridge:**
```
Budgeted Margin: 38.0%
  - Mix shift to lower margin categories: (1.2%)
  - Higher than planned markdowns: (0.8%)
  + Better than expected cost prices: +0.5%
  - Shrinkage increase: (0.3%)
= Actual Margin: 36.2%
```

## Pricing for New Products

### New Item Pricing Process

**Step 1: Competitive Benchmark**
- Research similar items at competitors
- Establish price range

**Step 2: Cost Analysis**
- Calculate full landed cost
- Include all charges (no optimistic assumptions)

**Step 3: Margin Target**
- Apply category target margin
- Calculate theoretical retail price

**Step 4: Price Point Selection**
- Round to psychological price point (.99)
- Position within good-better-best architecture
- Ensure price gap from adjacent items (minimum R10-20)

**Step 5: Sensitivity Test**
- At proposed price, is item compelling value?
- Customer willingness-to-pay assessment
- Risk: Too high (won't sell) vs. too low (margin opportunity lost)

**Step 6: Approval**
- Present pricing rationale
- Get sign-off from Buying Manager

**Step 7: Performance Review**
- After 4 weeks, assess sell-through
- Adjust pricing if needed (markdown or increase for next order)

---

### Pricing Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Overly Optimistic Costing:**
- Forgetting duty rate increases
- Underestimating freight (especially air)
- Ignoring currency risk
- **Result:** Margin shortfall

**2. Following Cost, Not Market:**
- "Cost went up, so we must raise price"
- **Reality:** Market may not accept price increase
- **Solution:** Absorb cost increase or redesign product for lower cost

**3. Price Gaps Too Small:**
- R79.99, R84.99, R89.99 (confusing, not enough differentiation)
- **Better:** R79.99, R99.99, R129.99 (clear tiers)

**4. Ignoring Competitors on KVIs:**
- "Our margin target is 35%, so R54.99"
- Competitor at R49.99
- **Result:** Lost sales on critical item
- **Solution:** Match on KVIs, earn margin elsewhere

**5. Permanent Promotions:**
- "Was R299, Now R199" forever
- **Result:** Customers wait for discount, erodes brand
- **Solution:** Promotional periods clearly defined, return to full price

---

## Special Pricing Scenarios

### Exclusive Brands / Private Label

**Higher Margin Opportunity:**
- No brand comparison (customers can't price-shop)
- Control full value chain (cost to shelf)
- Target margin: 45-50% (5-10 points higher than branded equivalent)

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Slightly below branded equivalent (R129.99 vs. R149.99)
- Communicate quality + value story
- Strong in-store positioning

---

### Bundled Products

**Example: Back-to-School Uniform Set**
- School shirt: R54.99
- School pants: R99.99
- School shoes: R149.99
- Total: R304.97
- **Bundle price: R279.99** (R25 saving)

**Benefits:**
1. Convenience for customer (one decision)
2. Guaranteed multi-item sale
3. Can include slower seller (e.g., specific pant style)
4. Higher transaction value

**Margin Consideration:**
- Blended margin on bundle
- Typically maintain target margin overall
- Discount comes from saved customer acquisition cost (3 items, 1 transaction)

---

### Seasonal Pricing

**Pre-Season (New Launch):**
- Full margin pricing
- Premium for newness
- Early adopters less price-sensitive

**Mid-Season (Peak Selling):**
- Maintain full price
- Selective promotions to drive volume
- Protect margin

**End-of-Season (Clearance):**
- Aggressive markdown
- Goal: Clearance, not profit maximization
- Free up cash and space for new season

---

## Technology & Systems

### Pricing System Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
1. Centralized price database
2. Price change workflow (propose → approve → execute)
3. Promotion management
4. Markdown scheduling
5. Price label generation
6. Reporting (price compliance, margin tracking)

**PEP Current System:** ERP-integrated pricing module

---

### Price Integrity

**Ensuring Correct Prices in Stores:**
1. System update (central)
2. Overnight synchronization to stores
3. Store repricing (before opening)
4. Shelf label updates
5. POS validation (price scan accuracy)

**Audits:**
- Weekly spot checks (HQ team)
- Monthly full audit (sample stores)
- Customer complaints monitored

**Non-Compliance:**
- System error: Fix immediately, honor lower price for customers
- Store error: Retraining, repeat offenses escalated

---

## Currency & Forex Management

### Import Pricing Challenges

**Rand Volatility:**
- ZAR weakens → Landed cost increases → Margin squeeze
- Example:
  - Initial quote: FOB $10 at R15/$ = R150 landed cost
  - Payment time: R18/$ = R180 landed cost (+20%)
  - Retail price unchanged: R299.99
  - Margin: 42% → 40% (2 points erosion)

---

### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Currency Hedging:**
- Lock in exchange rate for large orders
- Finance team manages (forward contracts)
- Cost: 1-2% of order value
- Benefit: Price certainty

**2. Buffer in Costing:**
- Assume worse exchange rate than current
- Build in 5-10% buffer
- Example: Current rate R15/$, use R16.50/$ for costing

**3. Local Sourcing:**
- ZAR pricing (no forex risk)
- Faster lead times
- Support local industry
- Tradeoff: Sometimes higher base cost, but more predictable

**4. Price Increase Pass-Through:**
- If significant forex impact, raise retail prices
- Communicate to customers (transparency)
- Risk: Competitive disadvantage if competitors don't follow

---

## VAT & Tax Considerations

**Value Added Tax (VAT):**
- Current rate: 15% (South Africa)
- PEP prices are VAT-inclusive (customer sees final price)
- **Retail price calculation:**
  ```
  Excl VAT Price = R69.99 ÷ 1.15 = R60.86
  VAT Amount = R60.86 × 0.15 = R9.13
  Incl VAT Price = R60.86 + R9.13 = R69.99
  ```

**Margin Calculation:**
- Always work with VAT-exclusive numbers
- Landed cost is VAT-exclusive (can claim back input VAT)
- Retail price must be converted to excl VAT for margin calc

**Example:**
- Landed cost: R40.00 (excl VAT)
- Retail price: R69.99 (incl VAT) = R60.86 (excl VAT)
- Margin: (R60.86 - R40.00) ÷ R60.86 = 34.3%

---

## FAQs

**Q: Can I price below cost to clear old stock?**  
A: Yes, with senior approval (Head of Merchandising or CFO). Better to convert to some cash and free space than hold unsellable stock.

**Q: How do I calculate margin if I only know the markup?**  
A: Use formula: Margin % = Markup % ÷ (100 + Markup %) × 100

**Q: Competitor dropped price on a KVI item. Can I match immediately?**  
A: Yes. KVI items have price match authority. Document competitor price (photo) and update in system.

**Q: My supplier increased costs by 15%. Must I raise prices?**  
A: Not automatically. First explore: Can you negotiate back down? Change specifications? Accept lower margin temporarily? If price increase necessary, get Buying Manager approval.

**Q: How do I price a unique item with no direct competitor comparison?**  
A: Use cost-plus with target margin. Test pricing with small initial order. Adjust based on sell-through. Consider customer value perception (what would they expect to pay?).

**Q: What if I made a pricing error and item is too expensive (not selling)?**  
A: Review at 4 weeks. If sell-through poor (<20%), recommend markdown to correct price point. Document lesson learned for future.
