## Core Merchandising KPIs

### 1. Stock Turn (Inventory Turnover)

**Definition:** Number of times inventory is sold and replaced in a period

**Formula:**
```
Stock Turn = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) ÷ Average Inventory Value

Alternative (units):
Stock Turn = Units Sold ÷ Average Units in Stock
```

**Example:**
```
Annual COGS: R120,000,000
Average Inventory: R30,000,000
Stock Turn = R120m ÷ R30m = 4.0 times per year
```

**PEP Targets by Category:**

| Category | Target Stock Turn | Days of Supply |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Fashion Clothing | 6-8× per year | 45-60 days |
| Basic Clothing | 4-6× per year | 60-90 days |
| School Uniforms | 8-12× per year | 30-45 days |
| Footwear | 4-5× per year | 75-90 days |
| Homeware | 3-4× per year | 90-120 days |
| Electronics | 6-8× per year | 45-60 days |
| Accessories | 8-10× per year | 36-45 days |

**Benchmark Comparison:**
- Industry average (value retail): 4-6× per year
- Fast fashion leaders: 8-12× per year
- Department stores: 3-4× per year

**Interpretation:**
- **High stock turn (8+):** Efficient, minimal aged stock, but risk of stock-outs
- **Target range (4-6):** Balanced approach, sustainable
- **Low stock turn (<3):** Excess inventory, cash tied up, markdown risk

**Improvement Actions:**
- Increase: Better forecasting, faster replenishment, lower initial buys
- Decrease (if too high): Increase safety stock, improve availability

---

### 2. Sell-Through Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of inventory sold within a period

**Formula:**
```
Sell-Through % = Units Sold ÷ Units Received × 100

Example:
Received: 10,000 units
Sold: 7,500 units
Sell-Through = 7,500 ÷ 10,000 × 100 = 75%
```

**Time Periods:**
- **4-week sell-through:** Early indicator (target: 25-35%)
- **8-week sell-through:** Mid-season check (target: 50-65%)
- **12-week sell-through:** Season-end (target: 70-80%)

**PEP Targets by Category:**

| Category | 4-Week | 8-Week | 12-Week | Full-Price Goal |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Fashion | 30-35% | 60-70% | 80-90% | 70% |
| Basics | 20-25% | 40-50% | 65-75% | 80% |
| School Uniforms | 50-60% | 80-90% | 95%+ | 90% |
| Seasonal (Winter) | 25-30% | 55-65% | 80-85% | 75% |

**Interpretation:**
- **High sell-through (>80% at 12 weeks):** Excellent performance, consider higher buy next time
- **Target range (70-80%):** Optimal, minimal markdown
- **Low sell-through (<60% at 12 weeks):** Problem item, requires markdown

**Actions by Sell-Through:**
- <30% at 4 weeks: Investigate (price, quality, marketing), consider early markdown
- 30-50% at 4 weeks: Adequate, monitor closely
- >50% at 4 weeks: Strong, consider replenishment if possible

---

### 3. Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)

**Definition:** Profitability of inventory investment

**Formula:**
```
GMROI = Gross Margin (Rand) ÷ Average Inventory Cost

Example:
Gross Margin Earned: R45,000
Average Inventory (at cost): R20,000
GMROI = R45,000 ÷ R20,000 = 2.25
```

**Interpretation:**
- **GMROI = 2.25:** For every R1 invested in inventory, earn R2.25 in gross profit
- Higher is better (more profit per Rand invested)

**PEP Targets:**
- **Minimum:** 2.0 (earn R2 for every R1 invested)
- **Target:** 2.5 - 3.0
- **Excellent:** 3.5+

**Category Expectations:**

| Category | Target GMROI | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Fashion (high margin, high turn) | 3.0 - 3.5 | High margin + good turn = high GMROI |
| Basics (medium margin, medium turn) | 2.5 - 3.0 | Steady performer |
| School Uniforms (lower margin, high turn) | 2.8 - 3.2 | Volume compensates for lower margin |
| Electronics (low margin, good turn) | 2.0 - 2.5 | Lower margin accepted |
| Homeware (medium margin, slower turn) | 2.0 - 2.5 | Slower turn limits GMROI |

**Improvement Levers:**
- **Increase Gross Margin:** Better costing, higher retail, less markdown
- **Improve Stock Turn:** Faster sell-through, less inventory held
- **Combination:** Optimize both margin and turn

---

### 4. Weeks of Supply (WOS)

**Definition:** How many weeks current inventory will last at current sales rate

**Formula:**
```
Weeks of Supply = Current Stock Units ÷ Average Weekly Sales Units

Example:
Current Stock: 5,000 units
Average Weekly Sales: 500 units
WOS = 5,000 ÷ 500 = 10 weeks
```

**PEP Targets:**

| Category Type | Target WOS | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Fashion Items | 8-12 weeks | Balance availability and risk |
| Basic Items | 12-16 weeks | Ensure continuous availability |
| Seasonal Items | 6-10 weeks | Limited selling window |
| Fast Fashion | 4-6 weeks | Short lifecycle, quick turn |

**Interpretation:**
- **High WOS (>16 weeks):** Over-stocked, markdown risk, cash tied up
- **Target range:** Appropriate coverage
- **Low WOS (<4 weeks):** Under-stocked, stock-out risk

**Actions:**
- **WOS >20 weeks:** Immediate markdown to accelerate sales
- **WOS <4 weeks:** Urgent replenishment (if item performing well)
- **WOS 12-16 weeks on basics:** Ideal steady state

---

### 5. In-Stock Rate (Availability)

**Definition:** Percentage of time a product is available for purchase

**Formula:**
```
In-Stock % = Days in Stock ÷ Total Days in Period × 100

Example:
Measured over 30 days
In stock: 27 days
Out of stock: 3 days
In-Stock Rate = 27 ÷ 30 × 100 = 90%
```

**PEP Targets by Category:**

| Category | Target In-Stock % | Rationale |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Core Basics (e.g., white school shirts) | 98%+ | Never-out-of-stock items |
| Basic Clothing | 95%+ | High customer expectation |
| Fashion Items | 85-90% | Acceptable to run out on trend items |
| Seasonal Peaks | 95%+ | Critical selling window |

**Measurement:**
- Track daily: Key items (top 20 sellers per category)
- Track weekly: All core basics
- Report monthly: Overall category in-stock %

**Impact of Stock-Outs:**
- Lost sales (immediate)
- Customer disappointment
- Competitive shopping (may not return)
- Brand perception damage

**Improvement Actions:**
- Safety stock increase on high-demand items
- Faster replenishment cycles
- Better demand forecasting
- Backup suppliers for critical items

---

### 6. Markdown Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of sales sold at reduced prices

**Formula:**
```
Markdown % = Markdown Amount ÷ Total Net Sales × 100

Example:
Total Sales: R1,000,000
Markdown Given: R150,000
Markdown Rate = R150,000 ÷ R1,000,000 × 100 = 15%
```

**PEP Targets:**

| Category | Target Markdown % | Max Acceptable |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| School Uniforms | <5% | 8% |
| Basic Clothing | <10% | 15% |
| Fashion Clothing | <20% | 25% |
| Seasonal Items | <25% | 30% |
| Electronics | <8% | 12% |

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Discount retailers: 15-25%
- Department stores: 25-35%
- Fast fashion: 20-30%
- PEP Target (overall): <18%

**Interpretation:**
- **Low markdown (<10%):** Conservative buying or strong sell-through
- **Target range:** Expected for risk-taking and variety
- **High markdown (>25%):** Over-buying, poor selection, or weak sell-through

**Root Causes of High Markdown:**
1. Over-buying (quantities too high)
2. Wrong product (style, color, price point)
3. Late arrival (missed selling window)
4. Quality issues (returns, defects)
5. Competition (better offers elsewhere)

---

### 7. Open-to-Buy (OTB) Variance

**Definition:** Actual spending vs. budgeted inventory investment

**Formula:**
```
OTB Variance % = (Actual Spend - Budgeted Spend) ÷ Budgeted Spend × 100

Example:
Budget: R5,000,000
Actual: R5,250,000
Variance = (R5,250k - R5,000k) ÷ R5,000k × 100 = +5%
```

**PEP Targets:**
- **Acceptable range:** ±5% of budget
- **Requires explanation:** ±5-10%
- **Escalation required:** >±10%

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive variance (over-spent):** Risk of excess inventory, cash flow impact
- **Negative variance (under-spent):** Potential lost sales, conservative buying
- **On budget (±5%):** Good planning and execution

**Management:**
- Monthly OTB review meetings
- Reforecast quarterly based on sales trends
- Flexibility to shift budget between categories (with approval)

---

## Sales Performance Metrics

### 8. Sales Growth

**Year-on-Year Growth:**
```
YoY Growth % = (This Year Sales - Last Year Sales) ÷ Last Year Sales × 100

Example:
Last year: R10,000,000
This year: R11,000,000
Growth = (R11m - R10m) ÷ R10m × 100 = 10%
```

**PEP Targets:**
- **Overall company:** 8-12% annual growth
- **Mature categories:** 5-8% growth
- **Growth categories:** 15-20% growth
- **New categories:** 50-100% growth (off small base)

---

### 9. Like-for-Like (LFL) Sales

**Definition:** Sales growth excluding new stores and closures

**Formula:**
```
LFL Sales Growth = (Sales from same stores this year - Sales from same stores last year) ÷ Sales last year × 100
```

**Importance:**
- Measures organic growth
- Excludes impact of store expansion
- True indicator of business health

**PEP Targets:**
- **Healthy:** 5%+ LFL growth
- **Acceptable:** 2-5% LFL growth
- **Concern:** <2% LFL growth (underperforming)

---

### 10. Sales per Square Meter

**Definition:** Space productivity measure

**Formula:**
```
Sales per sqm = Total Sales ÷ Total Trading Space (sqm)

Example:
Store Sales: R2,000,000 per year
Store Size: 600 sqm
Sales per sqm = R2,000,000 ÷ 600 = R3,333 per sqm per year
```

**PEP Benchmarks by Store Type:**

| Store Grade | Target Sales per sqm (Annual) |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Grade A | R4,000 - R5,000 |
| Grade B | R3,000 - R4,000 |
| Grade C | R2,000 - R3,000 |

**Category Expectations:**
- **High:** Fashion clothing, accessories (R5,000+ per sqm)
- **Medium:** Basics, footwear (R3,000-4,000 per sqm)
- **Lower:** Homeware, bulky items (R2,000-3,000 per sqm)

**Space Reallocation:**
- High performers: Consider space expansion
- Low performers: Reduce space, reallocate to higher productivity

---

## Quality & Customer Metrics

### 11. Return Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of sales returned by customers

**Formula:**
```
Return Rate % = Return Value ÷ Gross Sales × 100

Example:
Gross Sales: R10,000,000
Returns: R200,000
Return Rate = R200,000 ÷ R10,000,000 × 100 = 2%
```

**PEP Targets:**

| Category | Target Return Rate | Investigation Threshold |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Clothing | <3% | >5% |
| Footwear | <4% | >6% |
| Electronics | <5% | >8% |
| Homeware | <2% | >4% |

**Common Return Reasons:**
1. Size/fit issues (clothing, footwear)
2. Quality defects
3. Changed mind (customer regret)
4. Wrong item purchased
5. Gift returns

**Actions for High Returns:**
- **5-8% return rate:** Investigate specific styles/suppliers
- **>8% return rate:** Quality alert, consider stop-sale pending investigation

---

### 12. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

**Measurement:** Post-purchase survey or in-store feedback

**Scale:** 1-5 (1=Very Unsatisfied, 5=Very Satisfied)

**PEP Target:** 4.0+ average

**Drivers Tracked:**
- Product quality
- Product variety
- Value for money
- Store cleanliness
- Staff helpfulness
- Checkout speed

**Improvement Actions:**
- <3.5: Critical, immediate action required
- 3.5-4.0: Below target, investigate and address
- 4.0-4.5: Meeting expectations
- >4.5: Exceeding expectations

---

## Supplier Performance Metrics

### 13. On-Time Delivery

**Definition:** Percentage of orders delivered on or before agreed date

**Formula:**
```
On-Time % = Orders Delivered On Time ÷ Total Orders × 100

Example:
Total Orders: 100
On Time: 85
Late: 15
On-Time % = 85 ÷ 100 × 100 = 85%
```

**PEP Targets:**
- **Excellent:** 95%+ on-time
- **Acceptable:** 90-95%
- **Requires improvement:** 85-90%
- **Unacceptable:** <85%

**Consequences of Late Delivery:**
- Missed selling window (seasonal items)
- Lost sales
- Customer disappointment
- Competitive disadvantage

**Supplier Action:**
- **85-90%:** Performance discussion, improvement plan
- **<85%:** Reduce orders, activate backup suppliers

---

### 14. Quality Defect Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of units with quality defects

**Formula:**
```
Defect Rate % = Defective Units ÷ Total Units Inspected × 100

Example:
Inspected: 1,000 units
Defects Found: 15 units
Defect Rate = 15 ÷ 1,000 × 100 = 1.5%
```

**PEP Standards:**

| Inspection Level | Acceptable Defect Rate | Action Threshold |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Critical defects (safety) | 0% | Any defect = reject shipment |
| Major defects (functionality) | <2% | >2% = reject or negotiate |
| Minor defects (appearance) | <5% | >5% = price concession or reject |

**AQL (Acceptable Quality Level) Standards:**
- PEP typically uses AQL 2.5 for general merchandise
- AQL 1.0 for premium items
- AQL 0 for safety-critical items (children's wear, school items)

---

## Financial Performance

### 15. Gross Profit Margin

**Definition:** Profitability after cost of goods

**Formula:**
```
Gross Margin % = (Sales - COGS) ÷ Sales × 100

Example:
Sales: R10,000,000
COGS: R6,000,000
Gross Margin = (R10m - R6m) ÷ R10m × 100 = 40%
```

**PEP Targets:**
- **Overall Company:** 38-42%
- **By Category:** (See Pricing & Margins document)

**Margin Bridge Analysis:**
```
Budgeted Margin: 40.0%
- Markdown impact: (1.5%)
- Mix shift: (0.5%)
+ Cost savings: +1.0%
- Shrinkage: (0.3%)
= Actual Margin: 38.7%
```

---

### 16. Working Capital Efficiency

**Definition:** How efficiently inventory converts to cash

**Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):**
```
DIO = (Average Inventory ÷ COGS) × 365

Example:
Average Inventory: R30,000,000
COGS: R120,000,000
DIO = (R30m ÷ R120m) × 365 = 91.25 days
```

**PEP Target:** 75-90 days (inventory held before sold)

**Cash Conversion Cycle:**
```
Cash Cycle = DIO + DSO - DPO

Where:
- DIO: Days Inventory Outstanding
- DSO: Days Sales Outstanding (accounts receivable)
- DPO: Days Payables Outstanding

PEP Target: <60 days (cash cycle)
```

---

## FAQs

**Q: What's more important, stock turn or gross margin?**  
A: Both matter. Use GMROI to balance: it rewards both high margin AND high turn.

**Q: My category has high markdown but also high sales growth. Is that acceptable?**  
A: Depends. If markdown is strategic (traffic driver, clearance planned), yes. If due to poor buying, no. Analyze root cause.

**Q: How do I improve stock turn without hurting availability?**  
A: Focus on aged stock (markdown/clear fast). Maintain safety stock on core items. Faster replenishment cycles.

**Q: My supplier is 92% on-time. Is that acceptable?**  
A: Yes, above PEP target of 90%. But strive for 95%+ on critical items (e.g., back-to-school).

**Q: How often should I check these metrics?**  
A: Sales and stock-outs: Daily. Margin and sell-through: Weekly. Full KPI review: Monthly.
