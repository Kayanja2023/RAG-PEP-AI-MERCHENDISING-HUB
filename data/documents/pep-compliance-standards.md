## FAQs

**Q: Can we import clothing without fiber content labels?**  
A: No. It's illegal. Goods will be stopped at customs or risk fines in-store.

**Q: Supplier says SABS LOA is expensive and not necessary. Is that true?**  
A: False. It's legally mandatory for electrical appliances. Without LOA, goods won't clear customs. Non-negotiable.

**Q: What if we find child labor during an audit?**  
A: Immediate actions: 1) Document with photos/evidence, 2) Notify compliance officer and legal, 3) Terminate supplier relationship, 4) Ensure children are safely transitioned (not just fired), 5) Report to authorities if required.

**Q: Can we sell goods that fail quality inspection at a discount?**  
A: Depends on severity. Minor cosmetic defects: Possible with clear labeling ("seconds"). Major defects or safety issues: No, must be destroyed or returned to supplier.

**Q: How do I know if my product needs ICASA approval?**  
A: If it has a radio transmitter (cellphones, Wi-Fi devices, Bluetooth), it needs ICASA approval. Ask supplier for certificate.

**Q: What is AQL and how do I apply it?**  
A: AQL (Acceptable Quality Level) is a statistical sampling method. PEP typically uses AQL 2.5 (means max 2.5% major defects acceptable). QC team trained on sampling tables.
