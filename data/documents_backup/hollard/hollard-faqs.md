## Getting Insurance Cover

### How do I get a quote for insurance?
The best way to get a quote is through one of our professional brokers. Visit www.hollard.co.za/broker-tool to find a broker near you. Brokers can assess your needs and provide personalized quotes for various products. You cannot buy directly from Hollard - we work exclusively through our broker network.

### Why can't I buy insurance directly from Hollard?
Hollard operates through a broker distribution model because we believe professional advice is essential for making informed insurance decisions. Brokers help you understand your options, choose the right cover, and provide ongoing support with claims and policy changes.

### Do I need a medical examination for life insurance?
It depends on the type and amount of cover you're applying for. Some products require medical examinations, while others don't. Your broker will advise you on what's required for your specific application.

### How long does it take to get cover?
Once your application is submitted and approved, cover can often start within a few days. The timeline depends on whether medical examinations are required and how quickly you submit all required documentation.

### Can I change my cover amount later?
Yes, you can typically increase or decrease your cover amount. Contact your broker to discuss changes to your policy. Note that increases may require additional underwriting or medical assessments.

## Premiums and Payments

### How are my premiums calculated?
Premiums are calculated based on several factors including:
- Your age
- Health status and medical history
- Type and amount of cover
- Occupation (for some products)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, etc.)
- Payment frequency (monthly vs. annual)

### Can I pay premiums monthly or annually?
Most Hollard products offer flexible payment options including monthly, quarterly, or annual payments. Monthly payments are the most popular option. Discuss payment terms with your broker.

### What happens if I miss a premium payment?
If you miss a payment, there's usually a grace period (typically 30 days) during which your cover remains active. However, if payment isn't received within the grace period, your policy may lapse and cover will cease. Contact your broker immediately if you're having difficulty making payments.

### Do premiums increase over time?
Yes, premiums for most insurance products increase annually due to factors like inflation, increased risk with age, and changes in claims experience. Your broker will inform you of any premium increases in advance.

## Claims

### How do I submit a claim?
Contact your broker immediately when you need to claim. Your broker will guide you through the process, help you complete claim forms, and advise on required documentation. It's important to notify your broker as soon as possible after an incident.

### What documents do I need for a claim?
Required documents vary by claim type but typically include:
- Completed claim form
- Policy details
- Identification documents
- Death certificate (for life insurance claims)
- Medical reports (for disability/illness claims)
- Police report (for theft/accident claims)
- Proof of ownership (for property claims)

### How long does it take to process a claim?
Processing times vary depending on the complexity of the claim and how quickly all required documentation is submitted. Simple claims can be processed in a few days, while more complex claims may take several weeks. Your broker will keep you updated on progress.

### What if my claim is rejected?
If your claim is rejected, you'll receive a detailed explanation of the reasons. You have the right to appeal the decision or lodge a complaint. Your broker can assist with the appeals process and explain your options.

## Products and Coverage

### What's the difference between life insurance and funeral cover?
Life insurance provides a larger lump sum payout (typically hundreds of thousands to millions) to help your family maintain their lifestyle and meet long-term financial needs. Funeral cover provides a smaller amount (typically R10,000 to R100,000) specifically to cover funeral expenses.

### Can I have multiple insurance policies?
Yes, you can have multiple policies, and it's often advisable to have different types of cover (life, disability, critical illness, etc.). Multiple policies can work together to provide comprehensive protection.

### What's not covered by my insurance?
Common exclusions include:
- Pre-existing conditions (depending on disclosure)
- Self-inflicted injuries
- Participation in illegal activities
- War and terrorism (in some policies)
- Specific high-risk activities (depending on policy)

Always read your policy document carefully and discuss exclusions with your broker.

### Can I cancel my policy?
Yes, you can cancel your policy at any time by notifying your broker. Keep in mind that cancelling means you'll lose your cover and any premiums paid are generally not refundable. Consider the implications carefully before cancelling.

## Working with Brokers

### Why do I need a broker?
Brokers provide valuable services including:
- Expert advice on suitable products
- Comparison of different options
- Help with applications and paperwork
- Ongoing policy management
- Claims assistance and support
- Annual policy reviews

### How do brokers get paid?
Brokers earn commission from insurance companies for policies they sell and service. This commission is built into your premium, so you don't pay extra for broker services. The broker's incentive is to ensure you have appropriate cover and remain a satisfied long-term client.

### Can I change brokers?
Yes, you can change brokers. Contact Hollard or your new broker to facilitate the transfer. Your policy and cover remain unchanged when you switch brokers.

### What if I can't reach my broker?
If your broker is unavailable, you can contact Hollard's customer service line at 0860 103 933 for assistance, especially for urgent matters like claims.

## Technical Questions

### What is underwriting?
Underwriting is the process of assessing risk and determining whether to provide cover and at what premium. It involves reviewing your application, medical history, lifestyle, and other risk factors.

### What is a beneficiary?
A beneficiary is the person or people who will receive the payout from your life insurance policy when you pass away. You nominate your beneficiaries when taking out the policy and can change them at any time.

### What is a waiting period?
A waiting period is the time between taking out a policy and when certain benefits become active. For example, funeral cover often has a 6-month waiting period for natural death (accidents are covered immediately). This prevents people from taking out cover when they're already seriously ill.

### What is a premium holiday?
Some policies allow you to temporarily stop paying premiums (premium holiday) in cases of financial difficulty. During this time, your cover may be reduced or suspended. Not all policies offer this option - discuss with your broker.

### What happens to my policy if I emigrate?
If you emigrate, your policy may continue depending on the product and destination country. Contact your broker before emigrating to understand your options and ensure continuous cover if needed.

## Contact and Support

### How do I update my contact details?
Contact your broker to update any personal information including address, phone number, email, or banking details. It's important to keep your details current to ensure you receive important policy communications.

### How do I find my policy documents?
Your broker should have provided you with policy documents when your cover started. If you've lost them, contact your broker for copies. You can also request documents from Hollard's customer service.
